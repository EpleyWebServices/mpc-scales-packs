# MPC Scales Website

**Midi note scale programs for legacy Akai MPC sequencers. A collection of .pgm files organized into useful musical categories.**

## Downloading

The scales are available for download at the [MPC Scales website](https://mpc-scales.macian.online/download).

The LITE version only includes the recognized (i.e. named) scales and doesn't include the "All" folder. This is the recommended package for most users.

The FULL version of the scales pack includes every possible 5 to 9 note scale _(including mode shifts)_ within the 12-tone equally-tempered system of music. The programs are organized into 5 octave directories which comes out to a total of 12,000 nested subdirectories and over 140,000 files in the system.

## Extracting

You may need to use third-party software such as [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) to extract the files, due to the large number of folders used to organize the scales.

Alternatively, you can clone the packs directly from the [mpc-scales-packs repo](https://github.com/EpleyWebServices/mpc-scales-packs) if you prefer.

## Uploading

Upload the files to your MPC's hard drive or a flash drive and load the programs as you would any other MPC program.

## Using the scales

You'll need an external midi sound module hooked up to your MPC with a midi cable. Also, make sure your midi output channel is set to the same channel as your midi device.

Then, start playing pads and your midi device should be receiving notes in the selected scale.

## Scales player

To test run the scales before downloading, head over to the [scales player](https://mpc-scales.macian.online/scales/ENJOY!) to get a sense of how the scales are mapped to the MPC pads/banks. Record a sequence and switch the scales in real-time to get a sense of how the scales can be used on an actual MPC.
